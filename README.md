# StaTic-Tac-Toe

> Play TicTacToe against a static, no-JS webpage

There are many [Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) implementations.  
There are many *web implementations* of it, usually server-side.  
I guess there are many *client-side* web implementations of it.

But I wanted a completely static, client-side implementation.
One without any JS.
Just to see whether I can.

And [I can](https://benwiederhake.github.io/statictactoe/).
